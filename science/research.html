                In the summer of 2023, I attended the University of Alabama in Huntsville and NASA MSFC Heliophysics
                REU, where
                I joined a project with Dr. Amy Winebarger and <a href="https://athrayspanchap.github.io/">Dr. P.S.
                    Athiray</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project concerns <em>differential emission measure (DEM) inversion</em>. DEM inversion is a
                technique used to
                derive thermal distributions of plasma along line-of-sight using images of the Sun in multiple
                wavelengths.
            </p>

            <p>
                Specifically, the project concerns areas of the Sun where DEM inversion fails. It turns out that DEM inversion
                consistently has no solution at the tops of loops during and after solar flares.

                I worked with professor <a href="https://brianshuvephysics.com/">Brian Shuve</a> at Harvey Mudd College
                from the fall of 2021 through the summer of 2022.
                Over the school year, this was for credit; during the summer it became a full-time paid position.

                This project developed a model to explain matter-antimatter asymmetry and the neutrino mass problem
                simultaneously via the introduction of a scalar boson and sterile neutrinos.
                Prof. Shuve goes further in-depth <a href="https://brianshuvephysics.com/research-1#baryo-new">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>My main tasks for the project were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>implementing a set of coupled partial differential equations in Mathematica, and numerically solving
                    them to investigate if the model could
                    reproduce observed values for matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe, and
                </li>
                <li>comparing this implementation to two other implementations of the same problem, and correcting
                    errors in all three. This involved in-depth debugging,
                    as well as deriving equations using careful calculus and linear algebra.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This work is related to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01979">arXiv:1704.01979</a>.
                Though ultimately the model I worked with did not produce fruitful results, I gained valuable skills
                throughout the experience.</p>
