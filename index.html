            <p class="display-6">Hello!</p>
            <p>My name is Lucien Mallett. I am a recent graduate of <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a>, having earned my
                undergraduate degree in a Math and Physics joint major with a <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/hsa/program/">humanities concentration</a> in Linguistics.
            </p>

            <p>Currently, I am applying to graduate programs with the goal of earning a Ph.D. in solar physics.</p>

            <p>
            I think that anything can be interesting if you put in a little effort, so I try to learn at least a little bit about every new topic I encounter.
            I value learning for the sake of learning, and I value optimism while I do it!
            </p>
            <p>
            This means that I bring a broad set of interests and skills.
            I have strong foundational skills in chemistry, biology, engineering, and computer science on top of my math and physics degree.
            I also play Celtic harp, violin, viola, and piano; I am passionate about comic design, traditional animation, linguistics, and fiction writing;
            I love to do ballroom dancing, snowboarding, and archery.
            </p>
            <p>
            These interests often intersect in surprising ways. My knowledge of physics, linguistics, and music have all come in handy when I write fiction.
            Conversely, my artistic skills have helped me when I communicate my scientific work, from poster design to producing useful, colorblind-friendly graphics.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am passionate about scientific communication, not only to the public, but to fellow scientists in unrelated fields.
            This is why interdisciplinary knowledge is particularly important to me: it means that I can communicate with others using their own language.
