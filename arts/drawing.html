        <p>
            I've always loved to draw. I began truly developing my skills starting at around 10 years old.
            Aside from a single basic design course in high school, I'm entirely self-taught.
            I primarily consider myself a digital artist, specializing in character art and comic layout.
            I'm familiar with several professional art tools, including Clip Studio Paint, Paint Tool SAI, Toon Boom
            Harmony, and Medibang.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment, I'm taking somewhat of a break from drawing and animating to focus on my work in physics.
            However, there are several projects I look forward to resuming; most important to me is a comic series I am
            planning.
